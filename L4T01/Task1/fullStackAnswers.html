    <h1>Full Stack Web Development</h1>
    <p>
        Full stack web development refers to the practice of working on both the front-end and back-end aspects of a web application. A <em>stack</em> is a combination of technologies and tools used to build and run a web application. It typically consists of a front-end framework or library, a back-end server, a database, and other tools.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose of PHP</h2>
    <p>
        PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language commonly used for web development. Its primary purpose is to handle server-side tasks, such as processing form data, managing sessions, and interacting with databases. PHP is embedded in HTML code and executed on the server, generating dynamic content that is sent to the client's browser.
    </p>

    <h2>Customizability of WordPress</h2>
    <p>
        WordPress is highly customizable, allowing users to create websites with various themes and plugins. Themes control the appearance, while plugins add functionality. Users can customize layouts, styles, and features without extensive coding knowledge. However, for more advanced customizations, knowledge of PHP, HTML, and CSS may be required.
    </p>

    <h2>MERN Stack</h2>
    <p>
        The MERN stack is a popular JavaScript stack used for building modern web applications. It includes MongoDB (database), Express.js (back-end framework), React (front-end library), and Node.js (JavaScript runtime). This stack enables developers to use JavaScript throughout the entire application, promoting code reusability and efficiency.
    </p>

    <h2>Server Functions in Web Development</h2>
    <p>
        In web development, the back-end typically involves three main server functions:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Web Server:</strong> Serves static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to the client.</li>
            <li><strong>Application Server:</strong> Executes application logic, communicates with the database, and generates dynamic content.</li>
            <li><strong>Proxy Server:</strong> Acts as an intermediary between the client and the application server, handling tasks like load balancing and security.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Browser Request to Server</h2>
    <p>
        When a browser sends a request to a server, the server processes the request and returns a response. This process involves sending an HTTP request, processing it on the server, and receiving an HTTP response. The key difference between SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and CSR (Client-Side Rendering) lies in where the rendering process occurs. SSR renders on the server before sending content to the client, while CSR renders on the client side using JavaScript after receiving the initial HTML.
